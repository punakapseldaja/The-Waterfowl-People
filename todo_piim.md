# Future ideas to implement

## As soon as possible:

- Create a new duchy out of Estonia, consisting of Saare and Lääne provinces.
- Standardise Finnic province names. Omit *-maa* from province names to make them shorter and thus more legible on the map.
- Fix positions.
- New Finno-Ugric themed music.
- New title loading screen.
- Add credits.md in order to give credit to the artists of the content we use. Loading screens, music, developers who contribute, etc.

## In the far future:

### General

-

### Culture

- One single Finnic culture in Charlemagne start. **This does not include Sami.**
- Finnic will start fracturing into different cultures around 900, and by 1000 the transformation to multiple Finnic cultures should be complete. Similar to how Norse becomes Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, etc.
- Cultures descending from Finnic:

	* Finnish
	* Karelian
	* Veps
	* Bjarmian
	* Izhorian
	* Estonian
	* Livonian
	* South Estonian (need a shorter name: Ugalan? Ugandian? Tarbatuan? Maybe Seto, but traditionally that doesn't apply to the entire group of South Estonian)
	* Novgorodian (Need a better name. Ilman after Ilmajärvi?)

- When all (or perhaps 80-90+%) ex-Finnic provinces are under the control of a single Finnic-descendant ruler, the culture can reunify into Finnic, similar to how the many East Slavic cultures can become a unified Russian culture.
